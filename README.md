# Employee SQL Challenge
---
**Brief Description**: This challenge uses three separate tasks around data modeling, data engineering and data analysis respectively:
> - *Data Modeling* - Inspect the input CSV files and then sketch an Entity Relationship (ER) Diagram of the tables using QuickDBD.
> - *Data Engineering* - Create a table schema based on each of the six CSV files using the above data model and related relationships.
> - *Data Analysis* - Perform specific data analysis using SQL queries against each of the six tables created from the CSV files above.<br>

**Inputs**: The challenge takes in as input a total of six separate CSV files that are imported into their corresponding SQL tables for doing the analysis. These are uploaded into the folder titled *CSV files*.<br>

**Outputs**: The challenge provides the following outputs for each of the different activities.
> - *Data Modeling*: An ER diagram saved as an image file that plots the Entity Relationship for each of the different tables based on the input CSV files.  
> - *Data Engineering*: A SQL file that is used to create the table schema for EmployeeSQL.
> - *Data Analysis* - A SQL file that lists each question as a comment followed by the actual query that was executed for the results.<br>
